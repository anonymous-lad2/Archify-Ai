    "raw_content": "[Source 1]\nOnline vehicle for hire service Yellow Uber car in Moscow A ridesharing company (or ridehailing service ) is a company (or service offered by a company) that, via websites and mobile apps , matches passengers with drivers of vehicles for hire that, unlike traditional taxis , cannot legally be hailed from the street. In most cases, the company sets fares, which may vary using a dynamic pricing model based on local supply and demand at the time of the booking and are quoted to the customer in advance, and receives a commission from each booking. The vehicles used in ridesharing/ridehailing service are called app-taxis or e-taxis . Ridesharing companies were first founded in the 2010s following the proliferation of the Internet and mobile apps. [ 1 ] In the 2020s, a few companies began offering rides in robotaxis . The legality of ridesharing companies by jurisdiction varies; in some areas they are considered to be illegal taxi operations , while in other areas, they are subject to regulations that can include requirements for driver background checks , fares, caps on the number of drivers in an area, insurance, licensing, and minimum wage . Studies have shown that ridesharing companies have created net jobs [ 2 ] and improved the efficiency of drivers of vehicles for hire due to advanced algorithms that pair riders with drivers. [ 3 ] They have been subject to criticism for seeking to classify drivers as independent contractors , enabling them to withhold worker protections that they would have been required to provide to employees. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Studies have shown that especially in cities where it competes with public transport , ridesharing contributes to traffic congestion , reduces public transport use, has no substantial impact on vehicle ownership, and increases automobile dependency . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Ride-hailing services are increasingly adopting the use of autonomous vehicles. For example, on November 26 2025, WeRide , a Chinese autonomous vehicle"
